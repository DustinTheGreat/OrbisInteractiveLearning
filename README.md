# OrbisInteractiveLearning
This is a program to engage the learner with interactive learning.  

This will be a weekend project to demonstrate that I am capiable and passionte creating fun and responsive learning applications. I would like to make this an ongoing project and convert it into a mobile application using JSON. If you have an interest in helping me please email me @ dustinroberts96@gmail.com or you can find me on Jabber @ DustinTheGreat@jabb3r.de


In addition to engaging students who are raised in a hyper-stimulated environment, interactive learning sharpens critical thinking skills, which are fundamental to the development of analytic reasoning. Being primarly a self-taught programmer I know how difficult it can be to keep pushing yourself while learning, espesically when you hit your learning curve. I took up online curriculums such as Code Academy, Coding bootcamp, and TreeHouse. The main goal for these site were to get you hands-on becuase anybody can read a book and know "about" a programming language, but every programmer knows that the real learning comes in when you sit down and grind it out with a keyboard and a cup of coffee. This way of learning can be applied to all trades, so I made this program to help people study for a test.
