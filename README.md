# OrbisInteractiveLearning
This interactive learning program is intended to engage with the users through focus and critical thinking exercise.  These alternative approaches will be especially engaging to students who are raised in a hyper-stimulated environment, but would like to cultivate skills which are crucial to the development of analytic reasoning. Being  a self-taught programmer,  I know the difficulty of pushing oneself, especially when you hit your a curve. My main goal it give the users a hands-on experience, because reading about a programming language is a lot different than the actual process of sitting down and grinding it out at the keyboard. Although I apply this to programming, it can virtually be applied to all trades.

Furthermore, it is my hope that this will not only demonstrate my programming skills,  but also my  passion for developing pedagogical applications for the pursuit of higher education. In the upcoming months, I will continue to develop this project into a mobile application using JSON.
